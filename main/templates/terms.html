    <h1 class="h3 mb-3">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="text-muted">Last updated: {% now "F j, Y" %}</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">1. Agreement and Scope</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using ROOT 19 (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service and all policies incorporated by reference. If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that organization. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">2. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. The “Last updated” date will change when updates are posted. Continued use of the Service after updates take effect constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to revised Terms, stop using the Service.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">3. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be legally capable of entering into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction and comply with applicable laws.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of your account information and for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account. Notify us promptly of any unauthorized access or security incident.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">4. License and Access</h2>
    <p>We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Service for its intended educational and informational purposes. Except as permitted by law, you may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from the Service.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You will not, and will not permit others to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful, infringing, or harmful activities.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its security, including probing, scanning, or testing vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>Upload or transmit malware or content that is defamatory, misleading, or violates another party’s rights.</li>
      <li>Scrape, harvest, or collect data from the Service except as expressly allowed or permitted by law.</li>
      <li>Misrepresent your identity or affiliation, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">6. User Content and Feedback</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of content you submit (including feedback and bug reports), but you grant ROOT 19 a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, reproduce, modify, and display that content to operate, maintain, and improve the Service. You represent that you have all rights necessary to grant this license and that your submissions do not contain confidential information.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including software, content, and trademarks, is owned by ROOT 19 or its licensors and protected by intellectual property laws. Except for the limited rights expressly granted, no licenses or rights are transferred to you.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">8. Service Changes and Availability</h2>
    <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time without notice. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We may suspend access to protect the Service, comply with law, or address risk.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">9. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Service may link to or integrate with third-party sites or services. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party services is at your own risk and subject to their terms.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">10. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and share information. By using the Service, you consent to those practices.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">11. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and accuracy. The Service is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, ROOT 19 and its contributors will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to the Service or these Terms. To the extent liability cannot be disclaimed, our aggregate liability will not exceed the greater of (a) the amounts you paid to use the Service in the twelve (12) months before the claim arose, or (b) fifty U.S. dollars (US$50). Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless ROOT 19 and its contributors from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">14. Termination and Suspension</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for any violation of these Terms or for legal, security, or operational reasons. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive termination.</p>

    <h2 class="h5 mt-4">15. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which ROOT 19 is established, without regard to conflict of law principles. Where permitted by law, disputes will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in that jurisdiction, and you consent to that venue.</p>
